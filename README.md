# Extended Automated Pen Testing Assistant

## Overview
This enhanced script automates the initial stages of penetration testing. It includes domain reconnaissance and a basic vulnerability scan, with potential for additional scanning techniques.

## Requirements
- `dig` for domain information gathering.
- `nmap` for vulnerability scanning.

## Usage
1. Set the `target_domain` variable in the script.
2. Run the script: `./pen_testing_assistant.sh`
3. The script saves the results to an output file for review.

## Customization
- Adjust the `target_domain` for different targets.
- Expand the script to include other types of vulnerability scans or reconnaissance methods.
